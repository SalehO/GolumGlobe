Golem Globe, is a modified implementation of Wumpus World in Minecraft. The goal of our project is to create a Minecraft AI agent ,using Qtable and other ML and AI algorithims,that can navigate through a map containing pits and monsters to find the treasure/gold then go back to the start position without falling in a pit or getting killed by a wumpus.
